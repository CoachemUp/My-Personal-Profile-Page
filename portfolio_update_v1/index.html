        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Technology has always been an interest of mine. I spent 22yrs as a High School technology teacher, teaching in many different areas.  I recently retired and decided to follow my dreams and study Web development. 
        </p>
        <p>I have a Masters in Information Scince and Learning Technologies with an emphasis in Educational Technology from the University of Missouri. During my Masters degree we spent alot of time using HTML and CSS.  I hope to further my knowledge and use of these platforms to become a Front End Developer.</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I would like to further my knowledge of Web Design, always learning and mastering the following:</p>
            <ul class="skills">
              <li>HTML</li>
              <li>CSS</li>
              <li>JavaScript</li>
              <li>React</li>
            </ul>
        <p>My end goal is to become a Full Stack Developer.  Treehouse has given my a great start of obtaining this goal.  Learning is always ongoing, being static in a world that is changing is not going to propel you to the top.   </p>
